      </h1>
      <p>
        Freddie Mercury was a singer-songwriter and musician whose music reached the top of U.S.and British charts in the 1970s and 1980s. As the frontman of Queen, Mercury was one of the most talented and innovative singers of the rock era. At the age of 8, Mercury's parents sent him to a boarding school in Bombay , India, where he studied piano and spent his free time with his aunt and grandparents. Mercury attended the Ealing College of Art and befriended a number of musicians.<br><br> Mercury met his future bandmates, drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Brian May, around the time he moved to London in the 1960s. The album was the first taste of the group's signature harmonies and music styles, including ballads, folk, blues, metal, pop and rock, and included the single "Seven Seas of Rhye". Queen's popularity continued to soar through the late 70s and early 80s with A Day at the Races , News of the World and The Game. <br><br> In addition to his talents as a singer and songwriter, Mercury was a skilled showman. Artistic in nature, Mercury was also actively involved in designing the art for many of the group's albums. Before his death, Mercury worked in the studio with Queen.
